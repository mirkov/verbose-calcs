	* verbose-calcs.lisp (:compile-toplevel): Modified behavior to
	include format statement within the binding itself.  This way, if
	the calculation fails while establishing bindings, I will have
	some output available.
	(defvfun): Added header
	(vlet): Renamed verbose-calcs into vlet and vlet*
	(binding+echo): modified so that it prints binding as soon as it
	is established
	(binding+deferred-echo): This one accumulates print statements
	into acc.  This allows all the print statements to be done at
	once, sometimes after the bindings have been established
