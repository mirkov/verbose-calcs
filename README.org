#+title: ~verbose-calcs~ package

* Introduction and Background
  This package provides functionality for defining calculations that
  at the same time generate textual output with their results.  It
  provides two commands:
  - ~vlet~ and ~vlet*~ establish and prints out bindings, and then
    evaluate the body
  - ~defvfun~ is a ~defun~ that prints out argument values prior to
    executing the body

** ~vlet~ and ~vlet*~
   This is a ~let(*)~-like environment.  It establishes bindings.  But
   in addition, before executing ~body~, it prints out the value of
   all the bindings.

   If no bindings are established, ~body~ is executed inside a ~progn~.

* To do
  - Improve ~defvfun~'s documentation handling
  - Modify ~defvfun~ to print out the calculation result
  - Consider adding a preamble to ~verbose-calcs~
